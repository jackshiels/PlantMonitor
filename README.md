# Plant Monitor
This repo documents the process and resources used to develop a fully functioning plant monitor system using Arduinos, a DHT temperature and humidity sensor, and a moisture sensor instrument. Additionally, the project includes a humourous physical alert mechanism that lets the owner know their plant is low on water! Work on this project was conducted as a part of CASA0014, a module in the UCL Bartlett Connected Environments MSc course.

This project is split into three parts:
- Conceptualisation and experimentation
- Development and testing
- Deployment into the CASA lab
