# Plant Monitor
This repo documents the process and resources used to develop a fully functioning plant monitor system using Arduinos, a DHT temperature and humidity sensor, and a moisture sensor instrument. Additionally, the project includes a humourous physical alert mechanism that lets the owner know their plant is low on water! Work on this project was conducted as a part of CASA0014, a module in the UCL Bartlett Connected Environments MSc course.

This project is split into three parts:
- Conceptualisation and experimentation
- Development and testing
- Deployment into the CASA lab

# Conceptualisation and Experimentation
While some parts of this project were given via specification, others were drawn on through conceptualisation. Initially, three seperate ideas were floated. These were:
- Develop a mechanical base for the plant that rotates to align with the brightest sunlight spots in a room
- Added sensors and communication APIs to a group of plants that communicate their statuses with one other (a kind of shared intelligence!)
- Add a bell to the plant that is rung when the soil moisture dips below a certain threshold

The first idea was interesting, but would require a very powerful servo. Such a servo would be challenging to power from a small Arduino board. The second idea held promise, but coordination between students to build this plant network was not possible due to varying schedules. Lastly, the bell ringer idea was again hamstrung by the need for a powerful ringing servo motor, which would not be easy to integrate at the time.
